# Landlords-Ratings-Project
Web app that allows users to rate landlords and look up other user ratings.

## Project description
Wouldn’t it be nice to know what your landlord is like before you end up with a flooded basement that doesn’t get fixed for a month? With skyrocketing rents in the Bay Area, TenantConnect aims to hold landlords accountable and put some of the power in the housing market back into the hands of tenants. Thinking of signing a lease? Lookup a landlord by address, by name, or by using a map to see their ratings. Have an experience to share? Leave a review to recommend a good landlord or warn future tenants about landlord neglect. Need help with your current landlord? Connect with other tenants to discuss common issues and strategize.
